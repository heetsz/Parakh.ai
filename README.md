Generate a simple React component using shadcn/ui library.
Requirements:
- Functionality only, simple layout
- Use shadcn components like Button, Input, Card, etc.
- No advanced styling, just basic spacing
- Component name: <ComponentName>
- Props: <list props if needed>
- Do not include unnecessary CSS or animations
- Keep code clean and ready for logic integration


TO BE DONE:-

1.) FULL A2Z UI FIX - 
From email HTML to sucess-toasts, error-toasts to everything, each and every component
add images, 
hover effects, 
animations

2.) reset password, email verification
